# Autonomous Robot Navigation

This project implements an autonomous robot navigation system that uses computer vision to detect obstacles and path planning to navigate to a goal position.

## Features

- Computer vision-based obstacle detection
- A* path planning algorithm
- Autonomous navigation to a dynamically set goal
- Collision avoidance

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Run the simulator (follow the simulator's README instructions)
5. Run the autonomous robot:
```bash
python src/autonomous_robot.py
```
